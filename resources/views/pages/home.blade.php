        <h1>Project Opera</h1>

        <p>Project Opera is a non profit company located in Connecticut. Currenty the US is at a competitive disadvantage to its peers when it comes to Opera and the arts.  Startling statistics
            suggest that the top music schools are 70 to 80 percent foreign with the majority of them Asian. China recognizes the arts as soft power and as such gives students
            free tuition to study abroad.  We have been unable to compete with our German, French, or Italian counterparts
            because we do not have the structure in place to do so.  Our economists have been trained to view the economic choices as simply guns or butter.  But in order for
            Society to exist, for humanity to prevail we need the arts to survive.  Our mission is to help young opera singers perfect the art as well as to propagate
            that art and classical music in general to the masses. Having such a broad goal in mind we recognize that we need a strong organization
            behind us. Our fist step is to create an opera company to put on operas first within New England and then to expand to other
            regions of the US and eventually abroad. In order to put on a successful opera one needs singers, musicians, stage hands, ticket both operators,
            a marketing department, costume directors, etc. In short their are many moving pieces each with a cost component and a time restraint.
            Many opera companies have been formed over the years and many have failed at this endeavor leaving quite frankly the industry if their
            ever was one in tatters.  We believe that this leaves us with an enormous opportunity. The current state of Opera in America has devolved to a pay
            to play business model.  We feel that we must change this and will change this.  Our idea is to create a lobbying and economic devolopment like department, an opera "think tank" in order to make recommendations to local leaders when it
            comes to the arts.  Some of our strategies will be to use technology to our benefit including the use of simulcasts of our productions and to use vertical integration by owning our own symphony which will not only support our organization but
            will be able to stand on its own.  We believe America has talent and are announcing our first vocal competition "The Laura Ann Heckmann Award" named after an American
            soprano singer.  The award recognizes new young soprano singers between the ages of 18 and 24. This is an international competition where we hope to see the best of America go up against the best of the World
            while the singers are still in their formative years.</p>
